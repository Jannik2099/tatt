tatt is tom's arch testing tool 

Dependencies:
app-portage/eix    (for finding useflag combis)
www-client/pybugz  (for quering bugs )

Introduction

Arch testing includes many boring tasks. While gatt is intended to handle things that you do as a developer, like
closing the bug and the actual keywording, tatt focusses on the testing. 

Usage Examples:

Work on a stable bug no 300000. This will unmask the package and create two 
shell scripts for automated testing of useflag combis and rdeps 
./tatt.py -b300000

Print emerge commands for the stable rdeps of eix :

./tatt.py -d app-portage/eix

Print emerge commands for <=16 use flag combinations of eix:

./tatt.py -u app-portage/eix
