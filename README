Arch testing includes many boring tasks. While gatt is intended to handle things that you do as a developer, like
closing the bug and the actual keywording, tatt focusses on the testing.

Print emerge commands for the stable rdeps of eix :

./tatt.py -d app-portage/eix

Print emerge commands for <=16 use flag combinations of eix:

./tatt.py -u app-portage/eix
